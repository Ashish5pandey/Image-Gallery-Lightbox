#Image Gallery with Lightbox Effect
*This project is an image gallery that allows users to view images in an interactive and visually appealing way. When users click on a thumbnail, a larger version of the image is displayed in a lightbox (pop-up viewer), complete with navigation buttons to cycle through the gallery.*

Key Features:
Thumbnail Grid Layout: The gallery uses HTML and CSS to arrange images in a clean, responsive grid layout. The gallery adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on any device.
Lightbox Effect: Clicking on a thumbnail opens a larger version of the image in a lightbox. The lightbox overlays the page content and includes smooth animations for a modern look and feel.
Image Navigation: Users can navigate between images in the lightbox using "Next" and "Previous" buttons or by clicking outside the image to close the lightbox.
Responsive Design: The gallery is fully responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For creating the structure of the image gallery.
CSS: For styling the gallery and arranging the images in a responsive grid layout.
JavaScript: For handling the lightbox effect and implementing the navigation functionality for the images.
This project serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to implement an elegant and interactive image gallery with lightbox functionality.
